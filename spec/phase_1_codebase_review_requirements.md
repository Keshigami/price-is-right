# Phase 1: Login & gun.js Integration â€“ Functional Requirements & Constraints

## 1. Functional Requirements

### 1.1 User Authentication
- Users (eBay sellers) must log in securely via eBay OAuth.
- Support both web and mobile login flows.
- Session management must prevent unauthorized access.
- Users must be able to log out from all devices.

### 1.2 gun.js Data Sync
- User data (inventory, listings, preferences) must sync via gun.js in real time.
- Data flow must be robust against race conditions and data loss.
- Only authenticated users may read/write their own data.
- Data sync must work seamlessly across web and mobile.

### 1.3 Integration
- eBay OAuth tokens must never be stored in client code or hard-coded.
- gun.js must not expose sensitive user data to unauthorized peers.
- System must support future integration with additional OAuth providers.

## 2. Edge Cases

- User attempts login with expired/invalid eBay credentials.
- Network interruption during gun.js sync or OAuth callback.
- Simultaneous logins from multiple devices (conflict resolution).
- User revokes eBay OAuth access from eBay dashboard.
- Data corruption or partial sync in gun.js.
- User logs out on one device but remains logged in elsewhere.

## 3. Constraints

- No hard-coded secrets or environment variables in client code.
- All files < 500 lines; logic must be modular and DRY.
- All user inputs must be validated and sanitized.
- Secure error handling: never leak stack traces or sensitive info to client.
- gun.js and OAuth flows must be testable with TDD anchors.
- System must be ready for human QA (clear error states, test hooks).

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- User can log in/out securely on web and mobile.
- gun.js sync is reliable, with no data leaks or race conditions.
- No duplicated or unrefactored code paths in auth or data sync.
- All error and edge cases are handled gracefully.
- System passes manual QA for login and data sync flows.

<!-- TDD Anchors (for next phase) -->
// TEST: Can a user log in securely and reliably via eBay OAuth?
// TEST: Is gun.js data flow robust and free of race conditions or leaks?
// TEST: Are there any duplicated or unrefactored code paths in login/data sync?
// TEST: Is the system ready for human QA (clear errors, test hooks)?

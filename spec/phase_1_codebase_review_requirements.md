# Phase 1: Codebase Review & Refactor Requirements

## Objective
Systematically review and refactor all files in `components/`, `pages/`, `context/`, and `styles/` to address:
- Duplicated logic
- Unclear data flow
- Missing error boundaries
- **Local operation on mobile devices**
- **PWA (Progressive Web App) compliance**
- **Comprehensive testing for mobile/PWA scenarios**

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Duplication Elimination
- Identify and refactor all duplicated logic into reusable modules or utilities.
- Ensure DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles are enforced across all reviewed directories.
- // TEST: All previously duplicated logic is now referenced from a single source.

### 2. Data Flow Clarity
- Map and document data flow for each component/page/context.
- Refactor unclear or implicit data flows to be explicit and well-documented.
- // TEST: Data flow diagrams or documentation exist for each module; all props/context/state usage is traceable.

### 3. Error Boundary Coverage
- Ensure all React components/pages have appropriate error boundaries.
- Refactor to add missing error handling for async operations and user input.
- // TEST: All components/pages gracefully handle errors and display fallback UI.

### 4. Modularization & File Size
- Refactor large files (>500 lines) into smaller, focused modules.
- Ensure each file is <500 lines and has a single responsibility.
- // TEST: No file in the target directories exceeds 500 lines; each module has a clear, documented purpose.

### 5. Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs at the component and API boundary.
- // TEST: Invalid user input is rejected with clear error messages; no unvalidated input reaches business logic.

### 6. Style Consistency
- Enforce consistent code style (naming, formatting, comments) and CSS conventions.
- // TEST: All files pass linting/formatting checks; CSS follows project conventions.

### 7. Performance & Accessibility
- Identify and address performance bottlenecks (e.g., unnecessary re-renders, large bundles).
- Ensure accessibility best practices are followed in UI components and styles.
- // TEST: No major performance regressions; all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard and screen readers.

### 8. Local Mobile Operation
- Ensure all features work offline and on-device for mobile users.
- // TEST: App functions correctly without network connectivity on mobile devices.

### 9. PWA Compliance
- Implement and validate PWA requirements (manifest, service worker, offline support).
- // TEST: App passes PWA audits (e.g., Lighthouse); installable and reliable as a PWA.

### 10. Mobile/PWA Testing
- Define and execute tests for mobile and PWA scenarios, including offline, install, and device-specific flows.
- // TEST: All critical paths are covered by tests simulating mobile and PWA usage.

## Edge Cases

- Components/pages with deeply nested or circular data flows.
- Error boundaries for async errors (e.g., network failures, rejected promises).
- Shared logic between client and server (e.g., validation).
- Styles that affect global scope or override critical UI elements.
- **Mobile-specific UI/UX issues (e.g., touch events, viewport sizing).**
- **PWA-specific edge cases (e.g., service worker update, offline fallback).**

## Constraints

- No hard-coded secrets or environment variables.
- Each file <500 lines.
- Modular, testable outputs.
- No breaking changes to public APIs without migration plan.
- **Must support local/offline operation and PWA installability.**

## Acceptance Criteria

- All pain points (duplication, data flow, error boundaries, mobile/PWA) are addressed.
- TDD anchors are defined for each major correction.
- All requirements and edge cases are explicitly documented.
- Review/refactor process is modular and repeatable.

# Beta Transition Plan: From Janky Town to Beta
*Moving Simply eBay into production-ready state with smart camera/AI constraints*

## 🎯 Core Vision Analysis

Your dreaming algorithm identified three critical paths to beta readiness:

### Path 1: Smart AI Constraints & Freeze Frame Approach ⭐ **PRIORITY**
- [ ] **Extract position data and freeze frame** instead of fighting real-time lag
- [ ] **Buffer and discard frames** intelligently - never let one frame precede another during AI processing
- [ ] **Work WITH local AI constraints** not against them
- [ ] **Single frame processing** - capture → freeze → process → overlay results

### Path 2: Native Reticle Implementation with Smart UX
- [ ] **Periodic snapshot system** - automatically snap shots every X seconds
- [ ] **Position identification on frozen images** not live video
- [ ] **Overlay reticles on captured image** (not camera stream) 
- [ ] **Make lag invisible** - user sees smooth reticles that appear "real-time"
- [ ] **Fun freeze-frame experience** - embrace the limitation as a feature

### Path 3: Cloud Integration + Neumorphic Mobile-First Design
- [ ] **Mobile-first architecture** maintained
- [ ] **Smooth rounded neumorphic design** optimized for thumb navigation
- [ ] **Cloud backup/sync** while keeping local-first approach
- [ ] **Contributor code review** (login style fix and hydration override)

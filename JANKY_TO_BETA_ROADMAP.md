# 🚀 JANKY TO BETA ROADMAP
*Taking Simply eBay from experimental to production-ready with smart constraints*

## 🧠 Dream Algorithm Analysis ✅

Your nightly processing identified three golden paths:

### Path 1: Freeze-Frame Magic ⭐ **IMPLEMENT FIRST**
- [x] ~~Extract position data and freeze frame~~ **FOUNDATION BUILT**
- [x] ~~Buffer and discard frames intelligently~~ **SMART QUEUE READY**
- [ ] **Polish reticle overlay system** - overlay on captured image vs live video
- [ ] **Make lag invisible** - embrace local AI constraints as features
- [ ] **Single frame → freeze → AI → reticles** workflow perfection

### Path 2: Native-ish Reticle Experience 
- [ ] **Periodic smart snapshots** (already 80% there with useSmartCamera)
- [ ] **Position mapping on frozen frames** not shaky live video
- [ ] **Smooth reticle animations** that feel "real-time"
- [ ] **Visual feedback** for processing states
- [ ] **Fun factor** - make the freeze-frame feel intentional and cool

### Path 3: Real eBay Integration + Neumorphic UX
- [ ] **Actual eBay sold listings API** for real price estimates
- [ ] **Marriage-proposal-worthy pricing** 💍 (your words!)
- [ ] **Thumb-optimized neumorphic design**
- [ ] **Mobile-first with gesture navigation**

## 🔍 Contributor Review ✅

**GOOD NEWS: Your contributor is a genius!** 

### Hydration Fixes Analysis:
- ✅ **`_app.js`**: Smart client-side check with `isClient` state
- ✅ **`login.js`**: Proper `mounted` state to prevent hydration mismatch  
- ✅ **`index.js`**: Clean SSR bypass with `return null` and layout override
- ✅ **Race condition handling**: Perfect useEffect dependencies

**Verdict**: Keep this contributor! They understand Next.js hydration patterns.

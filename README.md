### 🚀 **The Philosophy: One Thing, Done Right**

This project represents a hard-earned lesson in product development: **focus beats feature creep every time**. Instead of building a swiss-army knife, we built a precision tool that solves one critical painpoint exceptionally well.

**The Painpoint:** Turning any phone camera into an AI-powered eBay listing machine.  
**The Solution:** Point. Scan. Sell. Repeat.  
**The Result:** A tool people actually use and love.

### 🛤️ **The Journey**

**Wild Collaboration:** This was born from the beautiful chaos of human-AI partnership - Claude as the wild horse providing endless innovation, GitHub Copilot as the patient sage, and Alan as the driver barely holding the reins with determination and joy.

**Hard Lessons:** Through countless iterations, sometimes brutal debugging sessions, and honest feedback about performance, we discovered the golden rule: master one thing completely rather than attempting many things poorly.

**Privacy Victory:** In a world where your data gets sold, Simply eBay keeps everything local. Your photos, your items, your business - it never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to list on eBay.

## 🚀 **Quick Start Guide**

‼️ **Prerequisite: Download LlamaFile AI Model**

Simply eBay uses LlamaFile to run the AI model locally on your machine for privacy and offline capabilities. Due to its size (around 4-5GB), the model file (`llava-v1.5-7b-q4.llamafile`) is NOT included in this repository. You need to download it manually:

1. **Visit the LlamaFile GitHub repository:** [Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile)
2. **Navigate to the releases section** or look for model download links. The specific model used by this project is `llava-v1.5-7b-q4.llamafile`. You can often find it linked from their main README or other community resources if not directly in releases.
    - A direct link for a compatible Llamafile (like the one used in development, `llava-v1.5-7b-Q4_K_M.llamafile`) can usually be found via Hugging Face or other model repositories that package for Llamafile. For example, search for "llava-v1.5-7b llamafile".
3. **Download the `llava-v1.5-7b-q4.llamafile` file.**
4. **Place the downloaded file** into the root directory of this project (i.e., `/Users/alanhelmick/Documents/GitHub/ebay-helper/llava-v1.5-7b-q4.llamafile`).
5. **Make it executable:**

    ```bash
    chmod +x llava-v1.5-7b-q4.llamafile
    ```

The `startup.sh` and `start-llava.sh` scripts expect this file to be present and executable in the project root.

## ⚡ **One-Command Launch**

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd ebay-helper

# Launch everything at once (handles all services automatically!)
./startup.sh
```

**🎯 After startup, visit:** `http://localhost:3000`

The splash screen will appear for 3 seconds, then redirect to the beautiful neumorphic onboarding flow!

## 🛠️ **What Gets Started**

- **🔫 Gun.js P2P Relay** → `http://localhost:8765`
- **🤖 LlamaFile AI Server** → `http://localhost:8080`
- **📱 Simply eBay App** → `http://localhost:3000`

## 📱 **Mobile Testing**

- **📱 WiFi Access**: `http://YOUR_IP:3000` (IP shown in terminal)
- **🔍 QR Code**: Scan with your phone for instant access
- **⚡ PWA Ready**: Add to home screen for native app feel

## 🔧 **Manual Service Control**

```bash
# If you prefer manual control:

# 1. Start Gun.js P2P relay
npm run gun-relay &

# 2. Start AI server
./start-llava.sh &

# 3. Start Next.js app
npm run dev
```

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### 🚨 **Port Already in Use**

```bash
# Kill processes on ports
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9    # Next.js
lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9    # LlamaFile
lsof -ti:8765 | xargs kill -9    # Gun.js
```

### ⚠️ **Startup Issues**

- **Problem**: "Permission denied"
  - **Fix**: `chmod +x startup.sh start-llava.sh cleanup.sh llava-v1.5-7b-q4.llamafile` (ensure all scripts and the model file are executable)
- **Problem**: "Command not found"
  - **Fix**: `npm install` first
- **Problem**: "Model not found" or LlamaFile server doesn't start.
  - **Fix**: Ensure you have downloaded `llava-v1.5-7b-q4.llamafile`, placed it in the project root, and made it executable as per the "Prerequisite: Download LlamaFile AI Model" section above. The file must be named exactly `llava-v1.5-7b-q4.llamafile` in the root of the project.
- **Problem**: LlamaFile error "no such file or directory" when running `./llava-v1.5-7b-q4.llamafile`.
  - **Fix (macOS with Apple Silicon)**: You might need to install `qemu-system-x86_64` if it's an x86_64 llamafile. `brew install qemu`. Llamafiles are generally self-contained but cross-architecture execution might need QEMU. However, try to find an ARM64-compatible Llamafile if possible for better performance.

### 🌐 **Network Issues**

- **Local Only**: All services run locally (no internet required after setup)
- **Firewall**: Allow ports 3000, 8080, 8765 if using across devices
- **Performance**: M1/M2 Macs run AI models much faster than Intel

### 🔄 **Clean Restart**

```bash
# Full reset and restart
./cleanup.sh && ./startup.sh
```
